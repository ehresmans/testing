                        restaurant-style, hamburger recipe 
                        made from lean beef. Skip the 
                        prepackaged patties and take the 
                        extra time to craft up your own, 
                        and that little extra effort will be 
                        worth it.</p>

                    <h1>Instructions:</h1>
                    <p>1. In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into four equal portions and shape each into a patty about 4 inches wide.</p>
                    <p>2. Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, turning once, until browned on both sides and no longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove from grill.</p>
                    <p>3. Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until lightly toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</p>
                    <p>4. Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato, burger, onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Set bun tops in place.</p>
