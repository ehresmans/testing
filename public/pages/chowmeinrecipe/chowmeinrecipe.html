                    <h1>Instructions:</h1>
                    <p>1. Heat half of the oil in a large pan over high heat. Add the white onion and cook for 3 minutes or until onion has started to brown and soften.</p>
                    <p>2. Add the carrots and celery, cook for 3-4 minutes until vegetables have started to soften. Add the cabbage along with 2 tablespoon of water. Cook, stirring constantly, until cabbage is wilted and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
                    <p>3. Remove the vegetables from the pan and plate onto a plate.</p>
                    <p>4. Heat up the remaining oil in the pan and add the shrimp. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side or until pink and opaque.</p>
                    <p>5. Add the vegetables back into the pan with the shrimp.</p>
                    <p>6. Remove the packets of yakisoba noodles from their package and run under hot water until you're able to break up the noodles, 1-2 minutes. Add the noodles to the pan with the shrimp and vegetables.</p>
                    <p>7. In a small bowl mix together the soy sauce, honey, ginger, garlic and sesame oil. </p>
                    <p>8.Pour the sauce over the noodle mixture, tossing to coat evenly. Add the green onions and cook for 1-2 minutes more.</p>
                    <p>9. Serve immediately</p>
